# **<span style="font-size:2em;">COHI Jukebox</p>**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The basic idea behind COHIRadia is to preserve historical broadband signals in the field of public broadcasting. However, a fundamental problem is that there are practically no recordings from the early days of broadcasting up to the 1980s.
However, it would be desirable to be able to play back signals on radio sets from the 20-50s, for example, which at least 'fit' these sets in terms of content. TheCOHI Jukebox section attempts to approach this topic by providing synthetic AM bands in the long and medium wave range. 
long-wave and medium-wave bands that modulated content and music of the time on a variety of common carrier frequencies. To make this possible, Claus Peter Gallenmiller and Hermann Scharfetter launched a joint pilot project in which 
developed software to generate such AM band signals under MATLAB and generated initial sample data. The series of recordings now opens with a recording entitled <strong>'Echoes of Bygone Radio Broadcasts: from 20's to 50's, Vol.1'</strong>, which impressively conveys what radio might have sounded like back then. The various 'stations' contain a rich music program from Claus Peter Gallenmiller's shellac collection on the one hand and a mix of excerpts from archive recordings of historical radio broadcasts on the other.</p> 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The recording has the same wav-IQ format as all previous COHIRADIA recordings and can be played back with the same software products described on the COHIRADIA hardware/software pages. For users who would like to compile their own AM bands according to their own taste, we would like to announce that there are plans to incorporate a corresponding synthesis tool into the COHIWizard, but this will probably take several months.</p>

If you like the idea of the COHI Jukebox, we would of course be delighted to receive your feedback.
