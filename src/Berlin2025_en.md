### COHIRADIA in 'Lange Nacht der Museen' in Berlin on 30-08-2025

On 30-08-2025 the [„Lange Nacht der Museen“](https://langenachtdermuseen.berlin/event/radio-senden-radio-empfangen-4f074f88/?utm_source=nl&utm_medium=om&utm_campaign=lndm25&utm_content=nl5) ook place in the German Muesum of Technology 
(Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin. There you could admire, among others, COHIRADIA in real-life operation. Claus-Peter Gallenmiller presented both the established PC-based version as well as 
his newest variant, the „COHI-Player mini“. This device is based on the RaspberryPi and especially optimized for mudeums and exhibitions. The 'Mini' does not require manual operation 
as it generates a complex MW-spectrum immediately after power-on. Thanks to the initiative of Claus-Peter Gallenmiller this player will be installed permanently in the German Museum of Technology and 
represents the first implementation in a public institution.
