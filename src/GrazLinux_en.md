### COHIRADIA at the Graz LINUX-days, 10./11 05.20266

On April 10 and 11, COHIRADIA will be participating in the [Graz LINUX Days](https://www.linuxtage.at/de/). 
So if you have the time and inclination, this event will give you the opportunity to experience the entire COHIRADIA system 
in operation. What makes this event special is that you can admire the platform in all of its currently supported variants:
* Classic setup with PC and COHIWizard
* Miniature version with the Raspberry Pi and COHI-Player mini from CP. Gallenmiller. 
Both systems will interact with a classic tube receiver from the 1950s via cable
and with a transistor portable radio from the 1960s via a small loop antenna.
The Red Pitaya STEMLAB and the OSMO-fl2k USB/VGA converter will be used as playback units.
This will allow the entire range of COHIRADIA systems implemented to date to be seen at once.

If you are in the area and want to find out more first-hand, this is a great opportunity. 
Amateur radio groups will also be present at the same event.

A little something special: Right next door, you can marvel at a fully functional low-field MRI machine built at Graz University of Technology 
and maybe even have your own brain scanned. 
This device is connected to COHIRADIA via the RedPitaya STEMLAB, which is used as the central 
signal converter in both projects.
