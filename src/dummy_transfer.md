The official software provided by RM for COHIRADIA is COHIWizard. It allows you to play the broadband recordings hosted in the archive on analog radios, but also provides a number of useful tools. Currently, these are:

    Viewer for inspecting spectra
    Annotator for commenting on your own recordings
    Resampling of recordings to sampling rates supported by STEMLAB125-14
    Wav header editor for post-editing or creating wav headers
    Synthesizer for creating your own AM bands (modulation of any number of carriers with audio content of your choice)

COHIWizard is available for both Windows and Linux. An executable version (exe) is available for Windows. In addition, COHIWizard is freely available as open Python source code on Github. Currently, only the Python version is available for Linux.

If you want to run COHIWizard under Python, you will find the installation instructions in the README file on the GITHUB repository.

If you want to access the latest version, which is still under development, please refer to the Experimental Version section.

Bug reports for version 2.2.x are welcome.
